DKIM, SPF, and DMARC are email authentication mechanisms used to combat email spoofing, phishing, and other forms of email-based abuse.

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is a method of email authentication that allows an organization to take responsibility for a 
message it sends. DKIM provides a way for the sender's domain to cryptographically sign an email message so that the recipient can verify that 
it was indeed sent by the authorized sender and that the message was not tampered with in transit.

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is an email authentication mechanism that allows the domain owner to specify which mail servers are 
authorized to send email from that domain. When a receiving mail server receives an email message, it can check the SPF record of 
the sender's domain to see if the message came from an authorized server. If the message did not come from an authorized server, 
the receiving server can reject it or mark it as suspicious.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is a protocol that builds on DKIM and SPF to provide a 
way for email receivers to determine whether an email message is legitimate. DMARC enables domain owners to specify how they 
want email receivers to handle email messages that fail authentication checks. Domain owners can instruct receivers to quarantine or 
reject messages that fail authentication checks or to deliver them to the recipient's spam folder.

In summary, DKIM, SPF, and DMARC work together to provide a way for email senders to authenticate their messages and for email 
receivers to verify that the message came from a legitimate source.
