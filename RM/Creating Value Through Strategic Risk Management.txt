Creating Value Through Strategic Risk Management?

Henry Ristuccia, a partner with Deloitte & Touche LLP, believes that companies can create value by adopting a
strategic approach to risk management. This approach involves identifying and managing risks that are closely
tied to the company's strategic objectives, rather than simply focusing on compliance and operational risks.
Ristuccia argues that strategic risk management can help companies achieve their business goals by enabling
them to take calculated risks that are aligned with their overall strategy. By identifying potential risks early
on, companies can develop plans to mitigate or manage those risks, which can ultimately lead to better decision-making,
increased innovation, and improved financial performance.

To implement strategic risk management, Ristuccia recommends that companies take the following steps:

 - Identify and prioritize strategic risks: Companies should identify the risks that are most closely tied to their strategic objectives,
and prioritize those risks based on their potential impact.

- Develop risk mitigation plans: Companies should develop plans to mitigate or manage the identified risks, which may involve implementing
new policies and procedures, investing in new technologies or resources, or adjusting the company's overall strategy.

- Embed risk management into decision-making: Risk management should be integrated into the company's overall decision-making process, 
so that potential risks are considered when making strategic decisions.

- Monitor and evaluate: Companies should regularly monitor and evaluate their risk management strategies to ensure that they are 
effective and aligned with the company's overall objectives.

Overall, Ristuccia believes that strategic risk management can help companies create value by enabling them to take calculated risks 
that are aligned with their overall strategy, while also ensuring that potential risks are identified and managed effectively.
